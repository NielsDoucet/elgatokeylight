Automate's Elgato Key Light Airs to switch them on automatically when you join a Google Meet or Zoom call

My work is giving out Elgato Key Light Air and have found it a hassle to switch them on and off as I join various video calls.  This bash script (works for Mac OS Monterey 12.x) monitors the Mac OS stream log and runs a curl command to activate the lights.

You need to change the local IP address of the lights based on your local setup in the script.  The rest is pretty straight forward.

Good luck!
